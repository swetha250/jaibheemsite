                <p><span class="hed">6.	Is it possible to build a house on the plot as I wish?</span><br>
                Yes. However, the statutory norms of construction set by the govt. rules should be followed.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">7. Is there sufficient water source?</span><br>
                Yes. We have abundant ground water available</p>
                <p><span class="hed">8.	Is the title of the property clear?</span><br>
                Yes. The land is freehold, marketable and free from all encumbrances.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">9.	What happens thereafter?</span><br>
                After receiving the Down payment, a receipt &amp; Confirmation letter will be given by the housing Society.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">10.	What assurance will I get for my money is not in risk?</span><br>
                At the time of booking you will get payment receipt, confirmation letter, automatically generated seniority id and login details where you can check the details of project progress and payment status. And as the society project is completely observed by government your money is always safe.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">11.	What is the Mode of payment &amp; Booking process?</span><br>
                All the payments will be accepted by the mode of Cheque, DD(Demand Draft), RTGS/NEFT in favour of “Defence Habitat Housing Co-Operative Society Ltd.” <br> Initially you have to make the down payment of about 25% of the total amount and membership fee of Rs 2500/- the remaining balance amount must be paid in 3 equal installments as and when demanded/ every 6 months depending upon the development of the layout.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">12.	Why is the price of this project so low?</span><br>
                Societies are non-profit organizations! When the society makes profit it will be divided among the members. Here unlike private layouts the money of clients are not in hand but invested in the society land. Unlike private Developers, societies don’t take huge loans from banks so they don’t include the expenses borne by the developer in terms of bank interests, so the value is lower than market value. </p>
                <p><span class="hed">13.	Why is the land procurement so slow? Why doesn’t the society acquire the total land at once?</span><br>
                Because to acquire the total and i,e 100 acres of land at once, the society needs at least 80 to 90 crores of money in hand , thus if the society takes a loan from any financial institution we will end up paying huge amounts of interest which will in turn increase the price of the land and you will end up paying more(around 500 per sq ft) than the price that we are offering now.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">14.	How many plots can I buy?</span><br>
                You can buy 1 plot under 1 membership.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">15.	Can I transfer the membership?</span><br>
                Yes, you can transfer the membership.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">16.	The location looks barren and no signs of development are visible. Why?</span><br>
                The land acquisition is under progress, it’s a turnkey operation, as and when we receive payments from the members at the time of booking, we push the money to landlord. Our commitment is to give the site on time.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">17.	What is the status of the land?</span><br>
                The development will be done phase by phase, these are agricultural land  and phase by phase it will go for conversion and then it will be sent for DPA approval.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">18.	When will the proposed development start?</span><br>
                The first phase of booking is going on now, once the first phase of booking is completed we will apply for conversion and DPA approval and immediately start the development. This will take 12 to 15 months of time.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">19.	When will the project be completed?</span><br>
                Our commitment is for 24 months from the date of booking and this will also be phase by phase.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">20.	Can we get the legal set of documents for verification?</span><br>
                The legal documents can be given, but many portions of land is still in legal verification, agreement stage, negotiation stage, which won’t help you to decide whether or not to buy the society plots.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">21.	Is there validity for the price list?</span><br>
                The price list may be subject to change from time to time.</p>

                The property can be resold by the client himself.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">28.	Can i buy commercial as well as residential sites?</span><br>
                Commercial sites will cost you more than residential sites, so we suggest that you buy residential sites first and then convert them to commercial sites which will be more cost effective for you.</p>
                <p><span class="hed">29.	We are looking for corner sites?</span><br>
                For corner sites the charges are 10 to 15% extra, however this applies only if you are getting allotment during registration, as societies follow the rule of first come first serve basis.</p>
